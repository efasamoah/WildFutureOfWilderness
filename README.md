# Land-use and climate risk assessment for Earth’s remaining wilderness

# SUMMARY
Earth’s wilderness areas are reservoirs of genetic information and carbon storage systems, and are vital to
reducing extinction risks. Retaining the conservation value of these areas is fundamental to achieving global
biodiversity conservation goals; however, climate and land-use risk can undermine their ability to provide
these functions. The extent to which wilderness areas are likely to be impacted by these drivers has not previously
been quantified. Using climate and land-use change during baseline (1971–2005) and future (2016–
2050) periods, we estimate that these stressors within wilderness areas will increase by ca. 60% and 39%,
respectively, under a scenario of high emission and land-use change (SSP5-RCP8.5). Nearly half (49%) of
all wilderness areas could experience substantial climate change by 2050 under this scenario, potentially
limiting their capacity to shelter biodiversity. Notable climate (>5 km year1) and land-use (>0.25 km year1)
changes are expected to occur more rapidly in the unprotected wilderness, including the edges of the
Amazonian wilderness, Northern Russia, and Central Africa, which support unique assemblages of species
and are critical for the preservation of biodiversity. However, an alternative scenario of sustainable development
(SSP1-RCP2.6) would attenuate the projected climate velocity and land-use instability by 54% and 6%,
respectively. Mitigating greenhouse gas emissions and preserving the remaining intact natural ecosystems
can help fortify these bastions of biodiversity.
